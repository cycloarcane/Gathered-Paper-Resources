- **[Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09871v1)**  
  **Summary**: The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) is a novel byte-level large language model (LLM) architecture that matches the performance of traditional tokenization-based LLMs while enhancing inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes raw bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary computational units. These patches are segmented based on the entropy of the subsequent byte, allocating more computational resources to complex data segments. A FLOP-controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8 billion parameters and 4 trillion training bytes demonstrates that BLT can scale models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. This approach improves both training and inference efficiency by dynamically selecting longer patches for predictable data, leading to qualitative enhancements in reasoning and generalization.

- **[Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663)**  
  **Summary**: This paper introduces Titans, a novel neural architecture that combines attention mechanisms with a neural long-term memory module to address the limitations of traditional Transformers in handling long sequences. While attention mechanisms function effectively as short-term memory by capturing direct dependencies within a fixed context window, they struggle with scalability due to quadratic time and memory complexity. Titans overcome this by incorporating a neural long-term memory module capable of memorizing historical context, thus enabling the model to utilize information from both recent and distant past efficiently. The proposed architecture supports fast, parallelizable training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that Titans outperform traditional Transformers and modern linear recurrent models across various tasks, including language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series analysis. Notably, Titans can effectively scale to context window sizes exceeding 2 million tokens, maintaining high accuracy in scenarios requiring retrieval of specific information from vast data sequences.

### Robotics & Automation

- **[ROLO-SLAM: Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only SLAM in Uneven Terrain with Ground Vehicle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02166v1)**  
  **Summary**: This paper introduces ROLO-SLAM, a LiDAR-based SLAM method designed to enhance pose estimation accuracy for ground vehicles navigating rough terrains. Traditional LiDAR-based SLAM systems often experience significant pose estimation drifts, especially in the vertical direction, leading to distorted global maps. ROLO-SLAM addresses this issue by implementing forward location prediction to reduce discrepancies between consecutive scans, enabling precise determination of position and orientation. The method employs parallel spatial voxelization for correspondence matching and develops a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate vehicle rotation. By incorporating geometric alignment and motion constraints into the optimization process, ROLO-SLAM achieves rapid and effective translation estimation. Keyframes are extracted to construct submaps, facilitating accurate pose estimation through scan-to-submap alignment. A global-scale factor graph is also established to mitigate cumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks in pose estimation for ground vehicles.

  **Summary**: Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking is a black-box algorithm designed to bypass safety measures in advanced AI systems across various modalities. It operates by generating multiple variations of a prompt through augmentations—such as random shuffling or capitalization for text prompts—until a harmful response is elicited. BoN Jailbreaking has demonstrated high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, achieving 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet with 10,000 augmented prompts. It is also effective against state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. The algorithm extends seamlessly to other modalities, successfully jailbreaking vision language models (VLMs) like GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) such as Gemini 1.5 Pro using modality-specific augmentations. Notably, BoN's effectiveness improves with an increased number of sampled prompts, following a power-law-like behavior across modalities. Combining BoN with other black-box algorithms, such as optimized prefix attacks, can further enhance its efficacy, achieving up to a 35% increase in ASR. This work highlights the susceptibility of language models to seemingly innocuous input modifications, which can be exploited across different modalities.

  **Summary**: Defines *low-level behavioral adversarial examples* for defeating deep-learning ransomware detectors that rely on runtime behavior. The authors formalize a gray-box threat model and an optimization that searches for source-code edits which induce minimal perturbations to storage/memory access patterns (e.g., entropy, throughput, page/GPA access stats) yet flip the detector’s decision. They prototype a **micro-behavior control** mechanism on leaked Conti ransomware—tuning number of threads, per-file encryption ratio, and post-encryption delay—to generate executable adversarial behaviors. Using RanSMAP features and a DL detector, the attack lowers recall from 0.98 to as low as 0.64 (Δ −0.34) and can mimic benign apps (e.g., SDelete), while noting that broader, more flexible behavioral manipulation is needed for consistently successful evasion.

  **Summary**: The authors propose **Pentest-R1**, a framework designed to automate penetration testing by enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It does so through a **two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline**:  
  - First, an **offline RL stage** trains the model on a dataset containing over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs to instill foundational attack logic.  
  - Then, an **online RL stage** fine-tunes the model via interactions within a Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, allowing it to self-correct errors and adapt strategies based on direct environmental feedback.  
  In evaluations on the **AutoPenBench** benchmark, Pentest-R1 achieves a **24.2% success rate**, second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On **Cybench**, it records a **15.0% success rate** for unguided tasks—setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source LLMs and matching top proprietary models. Ablation studies underline that both RL stages are vital to its performance.

- **[Cybersecurity AI: The Dangerous Gap Between Automation and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23592)**  
  **Summary**: This position paper warns that vendors routinely blur the line between *automation* (scripted tasks) and *autonomy* (adaptive decision-making), creating over-hyped “fully autonomous pentesters.” Drawing on robotics, the author introduces a 6-level taxonomy (Level 0–5) for “cybersecurity autonomy,” showing that today’s leading agents (e.g., XBOW, CAI) actually sit at Levels 3–4 and still require human validation. Mislabeling them can tempt organisations to remove oversight, potentially adding new vulnerabilities instead of closing them. The paper argues for precise terminology, transparent capability disclosure, and a human-in-the-loop model as prerequisites for responsible progress. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **[On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466)**  
  **Summary**: This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to autonomously conduct multistage network attacks, which involve complex sequences of actions across multiple hosts, including reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. The authors evaluate various LLMs across 10 emulated network environments and find that, in their standard configurations, LLMs struggle to perform these attacks effectively. To address this limitation, they introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that mediates between the LLM and the target environment. Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., "infect a host" or "scan a network"), which it then translates into low-level commands using an action planner, environment state service, and attack graph service. This approach enables LLMs to successfully execute multistage attacks in 9 out of 10 tested environments, highlighting the potential for LLMs to be utilized in automated cybersecurity operations when paired with appropriate abstraction layers.
