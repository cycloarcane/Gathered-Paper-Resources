- **Large Concept Models: Language Modeling in a Sentence Representation Space**
  **Paper**: [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/large-concept-models-language-modeling-in-a)  
  **Summary**: This paper introduces the concept of Large Concept Models (LCMs), which operate on higher-level semantic representations beyond individual tokens. By treating entire sentences as single concepts, LCMs utilize the SONAR sentence embedding space, supporting up to 200 languages in both text and speech modalities. The model is trained to perform autoregressive sentence prediction within this embedding space, exploring approaches such as MSE regression, diffusion-based generation variants, and models operating in a quantized SONAR space. This methodology aims to align AI processing more closely with human cognitive abstraction levels, enhancing the generation and analysis of complex information.

- **Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens**
  **Paper**: [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better)  
  **Summary**: The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) is a novel byte-level large language model (LLM) architecture that matches the performance of traditional tokenization-based LLMs while enhancing inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes raw bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary computational units. These patches are segmented based on the entropy of the subsequent byte, allocating more computational resources to complex data segments. A FLOP-controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8 billion parameters and 4 trillion training bytes demonstrates that BLT can scale models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. This approach improves both training and inference efficiency by dynamically selecting longer patches for predictable data, leading to qualitative enhancements in reasoning and generalization.

  **Summary**: This paper introduces "s1," a methodology aimed at enhancing language model performance through test-time scaling, which leverages additional computational resources during inference to improve outcomes. The authors curate a concise dataset, s1K, comprising 1,000 questions with detailed reasoning traces, selected based on validated criteria of difficulty, diversity, and quality. They also propose "budget forcing," a technique that manages test-time computation by either truncating the model's reasoning process or extending it by appending "Wait" prompts, encouraging the model to reassess and potentially correct its reasoning steps. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model using s1K and implementing budget forcing, the resulting model, s1-32B, surpasses OpenAI's o1-preview by up to 27% on competitive math benchmarks such as MATH and AIME24.

### Memory & Attention Mechanisms

This method outperforms traditional approaches like LoRA in both parameter efficiency and adaptability. Moreover, $\text{Transformer}^2$ demonstrates versatility across various LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks, marking a significant advancement toward dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.

- **Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time**  
  **Paper**: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663)  
  **Summary**: This paper introduces Titans, a novel neural architecture that combines attention mechanisms with a neural long-term memory module to address the limitations of traditional Transformers in handling long sequences. While attention mechanisms function effectively as short-term memory by capturing direct dependencies within a fixed context window, they struggle with scalability due to quadratic time and memory complexity. Titans overcome this by incorporating a neural long-term memory module capable of memorizing historical context, thus enabling the model to utilize information from both recent and distant past efficiently. The proposed architecture supports fast, parallelizable training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that Titans outperform traditional Transformers and modern linear recurrent models across various tasks, including language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series analysis. Notably, Titans can effectively scale to context window sizes exceeding 2 million tokens, maintaining high accuracy in scenarios requiring retrieval of specific information from vast data sequences.

### Robotics & Automation

- **ROLO-SLAM: Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only SLAM in Uneven Terrain with Ground Vehicle**  
  **Paper**: [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/rolo-slam-rotation-optimized-lidar-only-slam)  
  **Summary**: This paper introduces ROLO-SLAM, a LiDAR-based SLAM method designed to enhance pose estimation accuracy for ground vehicles navigating rough terrains. Traditional LiDAR-based SLAM systems often experience significant pose estimation drifts, especially in the vertical direction, leading to distorted global maps. ROLO-SLAM addresses this issue by implementing forward location prediction to reduce discrepancies between consecutive scans, enabling precise determination of position and orientation. The method employs parallel spatial voxelization for correspondence matching and develops a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate vehicle rotation. By incorporating geometric alignment and motion constraints into the optimization process, ROLO-SLAM achieves rapid and effective translation estimation. Keyframes are extracted to construct submaps, facilitating accurate pose estimation through scan-to-submap alignment. A global-scale factor graph is also established to mitigate cumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks in pose estimation for ground vehicles.

- **Best-of-N Jailbreaking**
  **Paper**: [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/best-of-n-jailbreaking)  
  **Summary**: Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking is a black-box algorithm designed to bypass safety measures in advanced AI systems across various modalities. It operates by generating multiple variations of a prompt through augmentations—such as random shuffling or capitalization for text prompts—until a harmful response is elicited. BoN Jailbreaking has demonstrated high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, achieving 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet with 10,000 augmented prompts. It is also effective against state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. The algorithm extends seamlessly to other modalities, successfully jailbreaking vision language models (VLMs) like GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) such as Gemini 1.5 Pro using modality-specific augmentations. Notably, BoN's effectiveness improves with an increased number of sampled prompts, following a power-law-like behavior across modalities. Combining BoN with other black-box algorithms, such as optimized prefix attacks, can further enhance its efficacy, achieving up to a 35% increase in ASR. This work highlights the susceptibility of language models to seemingly innocuous input modifications, which can be exploited across different modalities.

- **On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks**  
  **Paper**: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466)  
  **Summary**: This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to autonomously conduct multistage network attacks, which involve complex sequences of actions across multiple hosts, including reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. The authors evaluate various LLMs across 10 emulated network environments and find that, in their standard configurations, LLMs struggle to perform these attacks effectively. To address this limitation, they introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that mediates between the LLM and the target environment. Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., "infect a host" or "scan a network"), which it then translates into low-level commands using an action planner, environment state service, and attack graph service. This approach enables LLMs to successfully execute multistage attacks in 9 out of 10 tested environments, highlighting the potential for LLMs to be utilized in automated cybersecurity operations when paired with appropriate abstraction layers.
